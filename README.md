## Dose-effect association between smoking exposure and effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma

This repository contains the R code used for the analysis presented in the research paper "Impact of Dose-Effect in Smoking on the Effectiveness of Pembrolizumab in Patients with Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma." The study explores the association between cumulative smoking exposure and the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC).

### Abstract
The multicenter, retrospective cohort study investigates the impact of cumulative smoking exposure on the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic UC. Data from 95 patients treated with pembrolizumab were analyzed. The analysis assessed the association between smoking-related factors and time-to-event outcomes, including progression and all-cause mortality, using Cox proportional hazards regression models and cubic spline regression analysis. We found evidence of association between increased cumulative smoking exposure and lower hazards for progression and all-cause mortality. The results suggest that smoking exposure may influence the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic UC.
